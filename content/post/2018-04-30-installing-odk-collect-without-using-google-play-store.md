There are situations in which access to the **Google Play Store** might be limited for a variety reasons.

1. You may not have a **Google account** which is required to be able to access the **Google Play Store**;

2. There may be region or country-specific limitations to accessing either your **Google account** or **Google Play Store** or both; or,

3. There is simply no internet connectivity in the area you are located in.


Such situations would limit your ability to install applications including **ODK Collect**. This is a problem when the mobile devices you are going to use for your data collection are not yet configured and **ODK Collect** not yet installed.

This tutorial addresses the problem described in ***situation 1*** and ***2*** above where access to **Google account** and/or **Google Play Store** is limited but access to internet is not.

For ***situation 3***, steps 2 and 3 of this tutorial will still apply but it would require that you have already done step 1 ahead of time where access to internet is available which will allow you to download a copy of the application on your tablet.

This tutorial shows how to install **ODK Collect** without using **Google Play Store** (and without requiring a **Google account**). Instead, the **Open Data Kit** application package is downloaded direct onto your tablet and then installed directly without going through **Google Play Store**.
<br />

## 1. Download Open Data Kit APK
