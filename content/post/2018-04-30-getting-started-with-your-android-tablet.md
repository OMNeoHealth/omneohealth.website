Mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets have become valuable tools in data collection. Various applications have been and are being developed specifically to harness the utility of mobile devices for collecting data. An understanding of how mobile devices work specifically those powered by [Android operating system](https://www.android.com) is therefore a requisite knowledge for anyone involved in a data collection campaign that utilises these devices for data collection.

This tutorial gives a brief overview on how to get started with an Android device. We chose to focus on the use of tablet devices because we think that the smaller sized tablets (up to 7-inch) are a good mix of the mobility and handiness of a mobile phone and the wider screen size of a tablet which is good for fitting relatively dense question sets adequately. We also chose to focus on Samsung-branded because they are probably the most common brand of mobile devices available and we think most users have most likely had an experience using devices from this brand beforehand. For this specific tutorial, we use the **Samsung SM-T230** as the model device for instructional purposes.

This tutorial is aimed at enumerators who may have not been exposed to smartphones particularly Android-powered devices.

## 2. Charging the battery

Before using the device for the first time or when the battery has been unused for extended periods, you must charge the battery.

Connect the USB cable to the USB power adaptor and then plug the end of the USB cable into the multipurpose jack.

    - The device can be used while it is charging, but it may take longer to fully charge the battery.

    - If the device receives an unstable power supply while charging, the touch screen may not function. If this happens, unplug the charger from the device.

    - While charging, the device may heat up. This is normal and should not affect the device's lifespan or performance. If the battery gets hotter than usual, the charger may stop charging.
