There are situations in which access to the **Google Play Store** might be limited for a variety reasons.

* You may not have a **Google account** which is required to be able to access the **Google Play Store**;

* There may be region or country-specific limitations to accessing either your **Google account** or **Google Play Store** or both; or,

* There is simply no internet connectivity in the area you are located in.

Such situations would limit your ability to install applications including **ODK Collect**. This is a problem when the mobile devices you are going to use for your data collection are not yet configured and **ODK Collect** not yet installed.

This tutorial addresses the problem described in ***situation 1*** and ***2*** above where access to **Google account** and/or **Google Play Store** is limited but access to internet is not.

For ***situation 3***, steps 2 to 4 of this tutorial will still apply but it would require that you have already done step 1 ahead of time where access to internet is available which will allow you to download a copy of the application to be installed.

This tutorial shows how to install **ODK Collect** without using **Google Play Store** (and without requiring a **Google account**). Instead, the **Open Data Kit** application package is downloaded onto a computer and then transferred to the tablet for installation.

This process requires a computer and a USB to micro-USB cable to connect the tablet to the computer.

## 2. Transfer the ODK Collect APK to your tablet

<br />

### 2.2 Navigate to the directory of your tablet

By default, tablets are configured in such a way that when they are connected to a computer, they function as a USB mass-storage device (just like a USB memory stick). This means that when you connect to a computer, the tablet will appear on the computer as another storage device with its own directory.

So, to be able to navigate to the directory of your tablet, open **Windows Explorer** and you should find your tablet (if you have named your tablet, you will see the name of the tablet) listed as a storage device.

<img src="/img/tutorials/navigate-to-the-directory-of-your-tablet.png" />
<br />

When you click on the name of your tablet, a sub-directory called ***'Tablet'*** will appear and then you will now see the contents of your tablet organised in folders.
